        IgEvolution performs simultaneous repertoire and clonal tree reconstruction of a Rep-seq library taken from an antibody repertoire.
        To run IgEvolution, first run <a href="diversity_analyzer.html">DiversityAnalyzer</a> and
        then provide the resulting output directory as an input for IgEvolution:
    </p>

    <p>
        <img src="ig_evolution_figures/ig_evolution_usage.png">

            ./ig_evolution.py -i DIVERSITY_ANALYZER_DIR -o IGEVOLUTION_DIR
        </code>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>REP_SEQ_FILE:</b> Rep-seq library in FASTA/FASTQ format.
            Please note that Diversity Analyzer expects Rep-seq libraries with single layout of reads.
            If the original library is paired-end (e.g., raw files from Illumina MiSeq), please merge paired-end reads.
        </li>
        <li><b>DIVERSITY_ANALYZER_DIR:</b> output directory of Diversity Analyzer.

        <li><b>IGEVOLUTION_DIR:</b> output directory of IgEvolution.</li>
    </ul>

    <p align = justify>
        Please note that both DiversityAnalyzer and IgEvolution check the existence of output directory,
        <b>remove the directory if it exists</b>,
        and create an empty directory with name DIVERSITY_ANALYZER_DIR or IGEVOLUTION_DIR.
        So, we highly recommend to not specify an existing directory (e.g., the home directory) as output directories!
    </p>

    <p align = justify>
        If you want to launch IgEvolution on <b>several Rep-seq datasets</b> (e.g., time course of a vaccination),
        we recommend to <a href = "#combine_data">combine the results</a> of Diversity Analyzer on individual Rep-seq datasets,
        and run IgEvolution on the combined dataset.

    <p align="justify">
        <i>Clonal graph</i> is a new structure introduced in the IgEvolution paper.
        A clonal graph is an amino acid representation of the maximum spanning tree (MST) computed on
        putative nucleotide sequences from a clonal lineage.
        Vertices of the clonal graph correspond to distinct amino acid sequences.
        An edge connects amino acid sequences <i>v</i> and <i>w</i> if they correspond to nucleotide sequences <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>
        that were adjacent in the MST.
        In other words, clonal graph is computed by collapsing vertices of the MST corresponding to the same amino acid sequences.
